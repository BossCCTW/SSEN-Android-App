This Android application is my tesis by the time in Tesis Bachelor of Engineering

 ## ABSTRACT 
 
  This project is a kind of developmental research which aims to develop an application on android smart phone. The application can store educational data systematically and those stored data can later be extracted the useful information for a student. The useful information can help the student to improve his/her study plan for in each semester. During the research and development, the android studio is used as an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing and testing the application which is run on android smart phone operating system version 4.4 (kit-kat). The source code is written on java language programming which is run and compiled on android studio.  In order to make it easier for debugging the program, Genymotion, the simulator for android on personal computer, is used. For the data storage we use SQLite database which is a popular relational database management system for local/client storage in application software.  The experimental results show that the proposed application can run on android smart phone in functional. It can store the educational data systematically in each semester. The application can add 158 subjects and calculate grade point average (GPA) in advance. In addition the application can alert and notification when the lecturerâ€™s assignment meets a due date. By those reasons, the students who use this application should have more readiness for school.
